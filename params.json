{"name":"Ember-brunch","body":"# Brunch with Ember\r\nThis is a simple ember skeleton for [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) with working and up to date handlebars pre-compilng :)\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nClone the repo and run `npm install` & `brunch build`.\r\nSee more info on the [official site](http://brunch.io)\r\n\r\n## Versions (branches)\r\n\r\n* `master` contains some demo code to give an understanding of how things should work\r\n* `empty` is a clean version of the skeleton with no examples\r\n* `no-bootstrap` this is the same as `empty` but with bootstrap removed\r\n* `coffee` is the same as `empty` but uses coffeescript\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n    \r\n    brunch new myapp -s git://github.com/icholy/ember-brunch.git\r\n\r\nif you wanted to use the `empty` skeleton branch\r\n\r\n    git clone git://github.com/icholy/ember-brunch.git -b empty\r\n    brunch new myapp -s ./ember-brunch/\r\n\r\nOnce the project has been created, you can start a server by running\r\n\r\n    brunch watch --server\r\n\r\nthen visit `localhost:3333`\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n    config.coffee\r\n    server.coffee\r\n    package.json\r\n    README.md\r\n    /app/\r\n      assets/\r\n        index.html\r\n        img/\r\n          glyphicons-halflings-white.png\r\n          glyphicons-halflings.png\r\n      styles/\r\n      templates/\r\n      models/\r\n      views/\r\n      controllers/\r\n      templates.js\r\n      models.js\r\n      views.js\r\n      controllers.js\r\n      app.js\r\n      initialize.js\r\n    /vendor/\r\n      scripts/\r\n        jquery.js\r\n        console-helper.js\r\n        ember-latest.js\r\n        ember-data-latest.js\r\n        handlebars-1.0.0.beta.6.js\r\n        bootstrap.js\r\n      styles/\r\n        bootstrap.css\r\n    /public/\r\n      img/\r\n      stylesheets/\r\n      javascripts/\r\n    /test/\r\n      spec.coffee\r\n    /generators/\r\n      model.js\r\n      view.js\r\n      controller.js\r\n\r\n* `config.coffee` contains your app configuration. This is where you configure what Plugins / Languages to use and what rules are applied to them.\r\n* `app/` and subdirectories (excluding `app/assets`) contains files that are to be compiled. Javascript files, or files that compile to JS (coffeescript, roy etc.), are automatically wrapped as commonjs style modules so they can be loaded via `require('module/location')`.\r\n* `app/assets` contains images / static files. The contents of the directory are copied to `public/` without any modification.\r\n* `app/templates.js`, `app/models.js`, `app/views.js`, and `app/controllers.js` are loaded in `initialize.js` and are responsible for loading their respective classes.\r\n* `test/` contains unit tests.\r\n* `vendor/` contains all third-party code. The code wouldnâ€™t be wrapped in\r\nmodules, it would be loaded instantly instead.\r\n\r\nThe generated output is placed in the `public/` (by default) directory when `brunch build` or `brunch watch` is executed.\r\n\r\n## Other\r\nSoftware Versions used:\r\n\r\n* jQuery 1.7.2\r\n* Ember latest (master)\r\n* Bootstrap 2.0.4","tagline":"updated ember skeleton that works with the newer version of brunch","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
